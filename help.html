    <p class="learnMoreP">Hello! Welcome to AstroApp. This website is here to help you keep track of the planets in the night sky. There are two main sections to this website which you can navigate from the main menu. There is the planet location list and the news stories. The news stories will keep you up to data on the latest developments in space. This can range from rocket launches to new discovories! The second section is the planet list. The planet list keeps track of the location of all the planets in the solar system (apart from earth, I am sure you can keep track of that yourself). If your an admin on the top right of the main menu screen there is a link that will send you to the admin section of the site for news story editing, more help is located there.</p>
